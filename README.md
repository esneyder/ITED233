# Database Management System - ITED233 - W24

Thanks to this [blog](http://meandmyubuntulinux.blogspot.ca/2012/05/installing-oracle-11g-r2-express.html "blog") I manage to install Oracle XE and sqldeveloper on my Ubuntu VM, which otherwise will be alot tedious if done in Windows. A definite time-saver! :+1:
